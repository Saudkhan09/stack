    <h1> Random heading</h1>
    <div>
         I'm sharing a document together with a few project members via Microsoft Teams. In this document I have
            created customized list styles and styles for headings, and we use the program Zotero reference manager for
            our citations.  
        
    </div>
    <div>
     It worked just fine, until suddenly the font (which is the same everywhere in the document)
            changed from Calibri to Segoe for certain parts of the text, and all headings and heading numbers. Also the
            citations from Zotero have all changed. I can't pinpoint exactly when it this happened. Does anybody know
            what could have caused this?
